Welcome to my DSA repository!
This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems 
I have solved during my college journey. It's a mix of competitive programming ques, and
practice exercises.

Purpose: To document my learning journey in DSA and help others who are starting with algorithms and 
problem-solving.

Topics Covered:

1) Array :
--> Polynomial Function
--> Max Area created by elements in Array-Ball Velocity Dip 
--> HORNER Rule
--> Kth smallest element in arraky (using Partition Function) 
--> Top K smallest elements in array (using Partition
Function) 
--> Missing Element in Array -Pair Sum in Array

2) Linked Lists:
--> singly linked list ;
--> circular linked list;

3) Stacks and Queues :
--> Stack Implementation using Linked List
--> Queue Implementation using Linked List
--> Infix to Postfix Conversion
--> Infix to Prefix Conversion
--> Prefix to Infix Conversion
--> Postfix to Infix Conversion
--> Valid Parentheses

4) Trees and Heap :
--> Binary Search Tree (BST)
--> Heap Implementation (using Array)
--> Almost Complete Binary Tree
--> Binary Tree Implementation and Traversal Methods

5) Sorting and Searching :
--> Selection Sort
--> Bubble Sort
--> Heap Sort
--> Quick Sort
--> Radix Sort
--> Merge Sort 
--> Linear Search
--> Binary Search

6) Recursion and Backtracking :
